    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk the starter and water in a large bowl. Add the flour and salt. Mix with a fork until a stiff dough forms, then finish by hand to fully incorporate the flour. It will feel rough and shaggy, and slightly sticky. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature (68 F) for 30 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After the dough has rested, work the dough into a ball. To do this, grab a portion of the dough and fold it over, pressing your fingertips into the center. Repeat, working your way around the dough until it begins to tighten. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After about an hour, do one set of stretch and folds. Repeat 1 hour later. Let rise overnight, until the dough has doubled in size.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Remove the dough onto a floured surface, and shape into a round. Scoop up the dough and flip it over (the smooth side should be facing up). Cover and rest for 20-30 minutes. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After the dough has rested, flip it over again (the smooth side should be facing down now). Shape it again following the steps above. Flip it back over. With floured hands, gently cup the dough and pull it toward you in a circular motion to tighten its shape. Place into a proofing basket or lined bowl, seam side up. Cover with cloth.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> The dough needs to rise again. Rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The dough is ready when it looks puffy and has risen slightly, but has not yet doubled in size. Preheat your oven to 450. Cut a sheet of non-stick parchment paper to fit the size of your baking pot, leaving enough excess around the sides to remove the bread. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Make four shallow 4-inch long cuts at 3, 6, 9, and 12 oâ€™clock around the dough. Use the parchment paper to transfer the dough to the baking pot. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Reduce the heat to 425 F. Bake the dough on the center rack for 20 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, and continue to bake for 40 minutes, until golden brown.
