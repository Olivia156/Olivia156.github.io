    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Put the pasta in a small bowl and cover with 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock or water. Stir occasionally to make sure the pasta isnâ€™t clumping together.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Warm oil in a medium Dutch oven over medium heat, and prepare aromatics.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Add the greens, the remaining stock or water, and a big pinch each of salt and pepper. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a maintain an active simmer. Add the beans and cook, partially covered, until the liquid has reduced to about 1 cup and the greens are tender and silky, 10 to 15 minutes. Taste the greens and add more salt and pepper if needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Add the pasta along with the soaking liquid and simmer, stirring constantly, until the pasta is al dente, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the yogurt, and season with lemon zest and juice to taste. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed.</p> 
    <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Divide the pasta between 4 bowls and garnish with more yogurt.</p>
