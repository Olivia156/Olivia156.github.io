    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Before you measure out the kimchi, squeeze the juice out of it into a liquid measuring cup, this liquid is the "kimchi juice."</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Whisk the kimchi juice, gochujang and soy sauce together until the gochujang is completely dissolved.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Drizzle the sesame oil over the rice and use your hands to mix it, so each grain of rice is coated with oil, and there are big clumps.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Put the vegetable oil in a frying pan and heat over medium-high heat until hot. Add the chopped kimchi and stir-fry until the kimchi is starting to brown and is very fragrant.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Add the rice and stir-fry with a silicon spatula, pressing down on any clumps until the rice is uniform in color.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Pour the kimchi juice mixture over the rice, and turn up the heat to high. Stir-fry, tossing the rice occasionally until the rice starts to brown and doesn't stick together quite as much.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Since kimchi varies in saltiness, taste the kimchi bokkeumbap and season with more soy sauce if needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>When the fried rice is done, add the scallions and then plate. Top each serving with an egg.</p>
